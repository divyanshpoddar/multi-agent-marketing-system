Scalability Analysis for 10x Load Increase
This document assesses the system's ability to handle a tenfold increase in load and outlines a strategy for scaling. The current architecture is a single-process monolith.

Current State
Capacity: Can handle a low to moderate number of requests per second on a single server instance.

Architecture: Monolithic Python application running on Uvicorn.

Identified Bottlenecks for 10x Load
CPU-Bound Operations: The Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) means a single process can only use one CPU core at a time. CPU-intensive logic within agents will block the event loop and degrade performance for all requests.

Database Connection Pool: The mock MCP server will be replaced by a real database. A high volume of requests will quickly exhaust the database's connection pool.

Memory Usage: Each agent's AdaptiveMemory is stored in-process. A 10x increase in leads and campaigns will lead to a 10x increase in memory consumption, which may not be sustainable on a single machine.

Synchronous Handoffs: The direct method call from triage to engagement is synchronous. If the engagement logic becomes slow (e.g., waiting on an external API), it will delay the response to the initial triage request.

Strategy for Scaling to 10x
The strategy involves moving from a single-process monolith to a distributed, horizontally scalable system.

Horizontal Scaling (Stateless Services):

Run Multiple Instances: The easiest first step. Run multiple instances of the current application on different servers behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx).

Externalize Memory: The in-process AdaptiveMemory must be moved to an external service like Redis (for short-term and cached long-term memory) and a persistent database like PostgreSQL or a graph database like Neo4j (for long-term, episodic, and semantic memory). This makes the application instances stateless and allows them to be scaled independently.

Asynchronous Communication (Decoupling):

Introduce a Message Queue: Replace the direct method call for agent handoffs with a message queue like RabbitMQ or Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ.

New Flow:

The LeadTriageAgent finishes its work and publishes a message (e.g., lead.qualified) to the queue.

A separate pool of worker processes, subscribed to this queue, runs the EngagementAgent logic.

Benefit: This decouples the agents, improves fault tolerance, and makes the system more resilient to load spikes. The initial API call can return immediately after triage is complete.

Optimize Database Access:

Implement proper connection pooling on the application side.

Use a read replica of the database to handle read-heavy queries from the optimization agent, separating them from the write-heavy triage/engagement workload.
