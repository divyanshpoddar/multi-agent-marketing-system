Security Enhancement Suggestions
This document outlines recommendations to harden the security posture of the multi-agent marketing system for production readiness.

1. Authentication and Authorization
API Key Authentication: Protect all endpoints with an API key mechanism. The key should be passed in the request header (e.g., X-API-Key). FastAPI has middleware for this.

OAuth 2.0: For user-facing interactions or integrations with other services, implement OAuth 2.0 for more granular authorization.

2. Data Encryption
HTTPS/TLS: Use a reverse proxy like Nginx to terminate TLS, ensuring all data in transit is encrypted.

Database Encryption: Ensure the production database has encryption-at-rest enabled.

Secrets Management: Use a secure vault (like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) to manage database credentials and API keys instead of environment variables.

3. Input Validation
Strict Pydantic Models: We are already using Pydantic, which is excellent. Ensure models are as strict as possible (e.g., using constr for string length constraints).

Sanitize Database Inputs: Although we are using an MCP abstraction, ensure the underlying database queries are parameterized to prevent SQL injection.

4. Secure Dependencies
Regularly Scan Dependencies: Use tools like pip-audit or GitHub's Dependabot to scan for known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.

5. Rate Limiting
Implement rate limiting on the API gateway to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and abuse.
